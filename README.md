## Greetings & welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My nameÂ´s Eldar
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of different things, none of them connected to tech or things alike, iÂ´m working at tap room so IÂ´m quite proficient in talking bullshit and pouring beer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things. IÂ´m on my first year of IT and information systems at UiA.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with everything, IÂ´m like Socrates. I know that I know nothing. But IÂ´m not planning on flexing that like he did and end my life with drinking poison. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about almost whatever you like, I can pretend to be interested in a lot of things. But steer away from politics and crocheting.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a fascination for penguins, crows and ravens
