## Greetings & welcome! 👋

My name´s Eldar
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a couple of different things, none of them connected to tech or things alike, i´m working at tap room so I´m quite proficient in talking bullshit and pouring beer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things. I´m on my first year of IT and information systems at UiA.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with everything, I´m like Socrates. I know that I know nothing. But I´m not planning on flexing that like he did and end my life with drinking poison. 
- 💬 Ask me about almost whatever you like, I can pretend to be interested in a lot of things. But steer away from politics and crocheting.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a fascination for penguins, crows and ravens. I´ve played guitar for a while and can, most likely, work my way around most instruments that involves strings.
- 🎮 I play when I have time on Playstation, my latest addiction is Delta Force and my longest addiction is Hunt Showdown. My username is Babomba if you want a filthy casual to play with.
